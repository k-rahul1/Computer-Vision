Note: 2 time travel day is used

Operating System - Ubuntu 20.04.5 LTS
IDE - VS Code

Following files are uploaded:
1. Project3_Report.pdf -- Report of project
2. objRecognition.cpp -- Main program 
3. filter.cpp -- contains the implementation of functions used in main program
4. filter.h -- contains the declaration of functions
5. csv_util.cpp -- program to read and write to csv file
6. csv_util.h -- header file for functions used in csv_util
7. Makefile -- makefile of project
8. LabeledFeature.csv -- labeled database
9. uniqueFeature.csv -- class names
10. readme.txt -- instructions to rum the program

Note: Before running the program, make sure to change the path of video input.
To run the program:
1. Type 'make' in the terminal to build the file.
2. Type './display' to run the executable.
3. Follow along the prompt in terminal either to add label to database or use any classifier

Note: For detecting unknown objects, first press c to see the current label (which is unknown), then press n and enter the label and then again press c to see the correct label.
